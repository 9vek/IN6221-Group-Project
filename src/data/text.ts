E-Waste's recycling sites cover a large area.
As an individual or part of a household, the National Energy Agency (NEA) encourages residents to make use of e-waste recycling programmes voluntarily offered by industry stakeholders. E-waste can be properly recycled by simply dropping it off at the collection point with wide coverage.

Toxic waste recycling sites are concentrated on the West Coast.
The handling, transportation, treatment and disposal of toxic industrial waste are controlled under the Environmental Public Health (Toxic Industrial Waste) Regulations.Â Hence, the number of sites authorized to handle toxic waste is limited and shows a more concentrated distribution.

Drawing from the vibrant hues of sustainable progress, the bar chart before you unfolds the tale of Singapore's environmental stewardship through the lens of waste management. Here we trace the trajectory of waste disposal and recycling from the dawn of the millennium to 2014, showcasing the pulsating efforts of a society committed to ecological balance.

Through this visual narrative, witness the oscillating volumes of waste that were diverted from landfills to recycling centers. The bars represent more than mere statistics; they are the milestones of a nation's relentless pursuit of recycling over disposal, a testament to the eco-conscious spirit woven into the fabric of Singapore's urban landscape.

As the chart climbs, it invites us to reflect not only on the waste we generate but also on the strides we have taken to reclaim and repurpose it. This is the story of Singapore's green journey, charted through data, inviting us to ponder our role in the global effort to nurture our planet.
