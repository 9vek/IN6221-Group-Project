E-Waste's recycling sites cover a large area.
As an individual or part of a household, the National Energy Agency (NEA) encourages residents to make use of e-waste recycling programmes voluntarily offered by industry stakeholders. E-waste can be properly recycled by simply dropping it off at the collection point with wide coverage.

Toxic waste recycling sites are concentrated on the West Coast.
The handling, transportation, treatment and disposal of toxic industrial waste are controlled under the Environmental Public Health (Toxic Industrial Waste) Regulations.Â Hence, the number of sites authorized to handle toxic waste is limited and shows a more concentrated distribution.
